# == Definition: percona::mgmt_cnf
#
# Creates a simple my.cnf file for authentication purposes.
# The file will get '0400' permissions (readonly for the user).
# You can override this, but it is NOT recommended since your password
# will be in plain text in this file.
#
# We support the mysql and mysqladmin command in this config file.
#
# To ensure this file is available before creating any other resources,
# use the following statement:
#
# Percona::Mgmt_cnf<| |> -> Percona::Database<| |> -> Percona::Rights<| |>
#
# === Parameters:
#
# $name::     Path to the my.cnf file to create.
#
# $password:: The mysql password (plaintext).
#
# $user::     The mysql user. Defaults to 'root'.
#
# $owner::    Owner of the created file. Defaults to 'root'.
#
# $group::    Group that owns the created file. Defaults to 'root'.
#
# $mode::     Override the mode of the created file. Defaults to '0400'.
